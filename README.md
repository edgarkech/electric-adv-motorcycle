# The electrical ADV or touring motorcycle
This project is all about building an electric ADV or touring motorcycle with the following basic requirements:

Must have:
- base motorcycle available in Germany
- street legal in Germany
- ideally less than 200kg (215kg would be still OK) 
- top speed of 120km/h is sufficient
- range of 120+ kilometers when riding smaller backcountry roads at an avg speed of about 60km/h
- chargable at public charging stations ("type 2" chargers)
- comfortable enough to spend a full day in the saddle (OK, we will need some charging breaks)

Nice to have:
- capable of doing some gravel and light offroad stuff (more than 160mm suspension travel, 19" or 21" front wheel)

This github repository is all about organizing and starting up this project. I will start with some wiki pages explaining my motivation, detailing the requirements and of course collecting information (find it here: https://github.com/edgarkech/electric-adv-motorcycle/wiki).
